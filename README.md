# **CHALLENGE 5: GIT TERMINAL / GITHUB FORK**
##### (*fork from [gsanchezd github](https://github.com/gsanchezd/fdsw-github)* )

This is a very simple project for a basic portfolio-type website that uses [Bootstrap 5.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) and CSS for styling and was intended to help practice GitHub commands.

##### This site uses icons from [fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) and fonts from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

# **fdsw-github Project**
##### (*fork from [gsanchezd github](https://github.com/gsanchezd/fdsw-github)* )

This is a very simple project for a basic portfolio-type website that uses [Bootstrap 5.1](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/) and CSS for styling and was intended to help practice GitHub commands.
